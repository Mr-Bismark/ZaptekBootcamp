MY FIRST DAY AT ZAPTEK BOOT CAMP.

Hello everyone! This is Bismark once again.
Today was actually the first time we met for
the web development boot camp organized by
ZAPTEK.

Being our first day, we were showed how to 
install certain important and useful softwares and
create certain useful accounts on websites such
as Github.

Today we were introduced to Git, Github and
VSCode. It was a nice experience, especially
considering the fact that I have never participated in 
any web development boot camp before.

We were able to push our first file to our 
github account.

I really do hope that at the end of the seven
weeks, everything would be fine and I would be
well informed and well equipped for the 
web development world.

I hope to build my knowledge and expand to 
learn greater things as fast and as early as I can.
I am hoping that at the end of my 4-year stay
on KNUST campus, I would have become a seasoned
web developer, knowing all the technologies associated with
it, become a seasoned software developer as well, and all
the other fields that I am yet to discover.

See you in the next meetings with ZAPTEK.
